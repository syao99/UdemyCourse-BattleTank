Dev Process:
- Iterative Loop: World, Tank Controls, Player2, UI, Repeat
- Each Time: Ask "What's least fun?"
- Reasonably Limited Scope

Base Rules and Concept:
- Basic tank shooter game; 3rd person (extra: 1st person mode).
- Opponent tanks can be AI or human.
- Map: Use terrain and possibly bases, etc. to provide cover.
- FFA, Maybe teams?
- Fine tune: Projectile arc, damage, armor, ammo, ammo pickup and armor repair locations (i.e. a base).
- Bonus: Separate damage components. (i.e. Disabling engine/weapons.)

Special FX/Experience:
- Tank components: Separately moving/animated treads, wheels, body, turret, gun, secondary gun?
- Recoil animation, sounds of engine, gun, secondary, engine, explosions
- Music?
- Assets: Meshes, UV's, Textures, Materials


Controls:
WASD/LS: Drive forward/backward, Turn left/right (RELATIVE TO TANK BASE!)
Mouse/RS: Aim/turn turret
RT/Left Click: Pew!
LT/Right Click: Secondary
